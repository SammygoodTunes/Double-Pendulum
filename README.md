# Fibonacci-Word-Fractal
Recreation of the Double Pendulum.

Explanation:
===================

The double pendulum is a set of two pendulums connected to each other.
Adding an immense amount of formulas for motion and acceleration, the double pendulum can create some fascinatingly choatic movements.
Each pattern it creates is unique every time.

My version of the double pendulum is trash. But, it does work.
I'll probably develop on it more, probably quadruple-check the formulas for any errors.
